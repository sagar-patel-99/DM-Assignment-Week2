 ## Assignment 2 :
 1. Used pycaret for kaggle dataset analysis and did different type of classifications.
 2. I uploaded the dataset through google drive and then used compare model function to figure out which model's accuracy is best for that specific classification of dataset. Using that I explored and created different matrix to understand dataset in a more easy way. 
 3. I was able to do all the classification with uniqe datasets and was able to do whole processing. However I did find some difficulties in time series forecasting. I was getting error on setup() I tried sorting that out but was finding some issues. I was able to do the time series forecasting in both with and without exogeneous variable.
